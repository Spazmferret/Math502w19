    "## The example of octave stretch in a piano\n",
    "This example is based on the fact that a piano wire is not a perfectly elastic spring, but has characteristics like a metal beam. There is a small parameter $\\epsilon$ in the problem, that measures the departure from perfect elasticity. This change actually affects the tuning of a real piano.\n",

    "Music notes are typically generated by vibrations in some object (the strings of a violin, the wires in a piano, the metal bars in a xylophone, even vibrations of an air column in a clarinet, flute, saxophone, etc.) The pitch of a note is characterized by a frequency of vibration -- for instance, concert \"A\" is set at 440 Hertz (cycles per second). Pairs of notes sound nice together if their frequencies are in the ratio of a small integer fraction. For instance, A is 440 Hz, and E is 660Hz, which is 3/2 the frequency of A. (This interval, from A to E, is called a perfect fifth. It is the first tone step you hear in the song \"Twinkle twinkle little star\", or in French \"Ah! vous dirai-je, maman.\") A leap by an octave is a doubling of frequency, such as 440Hz to 880 Hz (this the leap you hear in the tune \"SomeWhere over the rainbow\" from the Wizard of Oz.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple string vibrates with a fundamental frequency, as well with harmonics that are frequencies at integer multiples of the fundamental By tuning to the harmonics, it is possible to tune a piano by ear -- adjusting the tension on a string until the frequencies line up. However, a real piano has more complicated harmonics, so simple tuning gives a slight error in the alignment of the notes. Indeed, over the 8 octaves of a piano, the errors accumulate into something that is clearly noticable by ear.\n",

    "We will show here the PDE describing the vibrations of a simple string, and then consider the case of a real piano wire that has more complex vibrations. \n",

    "The PDE governing the vibrations of a simple is derived from Newton's law (mass times acceleration equals force), giving\n",
    "$$\\rho A \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} = T \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}, \\mbox{ for $0<x<L$},$$\n",
    "where $y=y(x,t)$ is the (vertical) displacement of a string from rest, $\\rho$ is the density of the string, $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the string, and $T$ is the tension on the string (so the term $T \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}$ represents the force on the string due to the curvature of the vibrating string). It is pretty standard to rewrite the PDE as\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial t^2} - c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}=0, \\mbox{ for $0<x<L$},$$ where\n",
    "$c^2 = T/\\rho A$ is the speed of propagation (squared) for vibrations in the string. \n",

    "\n",
    "We include the boundary conditions\n",

    "$$y_n = e^{i\\omega_n t} \\sin\\frac{n\\pi }{L}x, \\mbox{ with } \\omega_n = \\frac{n\\pi }{L}c.$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that area $A$ is proportional to radius squared ($a^2$) as is $k^2$, so the parameter $\\epsilon$ depends on the fourth order of the radius of the wire. (i.e. skinny wires are closer to the simple string example above.) \n",
    "\n",
    "For a typical piano wire, we might have a radius of $a=1mm$, so $k^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\times 10^{-6} m^2$, $L=1m$, $T=1000N$ (Newtons), and for steel we have a density $\\rho = 7800 kg/m^3$ and modulus $E = 2\\times 10^{11}$ in SI units. This gives\n",
